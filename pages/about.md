My name is Fred Schoeneman.  I've been an Army Ranger, a writer, a salesman, and a commercial diver, I've worked in startups and founded one.  For the last year I've been working as a professional Ruby on Rails developer at a pretty awesome Ruby on Rails consulting shop called [General Things](http://generalthings.com/ideas/philosophy/) in San Francisco.  Great guys:  [Chris](http://chris.merciboq.com/), [Jason](http://jasonsupafly.merciboq.com/), [Dan](http://dansteinicke.merciboq.com/), [Carlo](http://carlo.merciboq.com/), [Ryan](http://ryan.merciboq.com/).  I Totally recommend them if you need something awesome built -- particularly if that awesome thing is a ginormous database driven website with millions of users and billions of page views and thousands of high quality videos streaming out to iPads and laptops and smartphones across the world.  And the owner, [Nick Hodulik](http://nick.merciboq.com/), is pretty easy to work for.  [No, really](http://generalthings.com/ideas/philosophy/).  I was able to learn a ton from these guys, but now I want to take some of that knowledge and use it to build some of my own projects.  Anydiver is one of these projects.
